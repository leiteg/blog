Well, hello there and welcome to my new blog. I am Gustavo Leite, a computer
science student who loves to teach and share thoughts. Although I indent to use
this blog to talk mainly about programming and computing, I may occasionally
talk about my life and hobbies, let's see.

Thanks for passing by! ðŸ‘‹
