Hi, I'm Gustavo Leite! A computer science PhD student at the Institute of
Computing from Campinas State University (Unicamp) in Brazil. I am currently
doing research on high-performance computing and parallel programming models. I
am also interested in compilers, programming languages, and computer
architecture.
